Introduction
------------

This is a set of C headers containing macros and static functions that
are expected to work on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like[Unix-like systems]
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows[MS Windows] that have
been extracted from https://www.shlomifish.org/[Shlomi Fish´s projects].

They include:

1. sizeof-aware wrappers for https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/memory/malloc[malloc()/realloc()]

2. +COUNT()+ and +LAST()+ macros.

3. +DLLEXPORT+ symbols-modifiers.

4. +likely()+ and +unlikely()+ CPU branch-prediction hints (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/109710[Stack Overflow question]).

5. +long long+ sprintf()-formats

6. +min()+ and +max()+

7. +rinutils/portable_time.h+ for cross-platform time querying.

8. Some string utilities as inline functions.

9. +typeof_wrap.h+ for https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/auto[C++-"auto"]-like macros.

10. +GCC_UNUSED+ for silencing warnings.

11. +rinutils/rin_cmocka.h+ for reducing https://cmocka.org/[cmocka’s] boilerplate.

**Note:** we only support the https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Standards.html[`-std=gnu11`]
dialect as supported by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection[GCC],
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang[clang] and compatible compilers. Other compilers
are not supported.
